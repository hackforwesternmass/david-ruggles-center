The DRC in Florence, Massachusetts offers monthly public walking tours and host visiting school groups using original curriculum. Museum exhibits highlight David Ruggles, Sojourner Truth, Lydia Maria Child and the local Underground Railroad. We sponsor a range of programs pertaining to this past and related contemporary issues.
